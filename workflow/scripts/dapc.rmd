# Goal
The goal here is to successfully implement the 'Discriminant analysis of principle components' (DAPC) technique to identify population groupings.

## Credit
This was made as a proof-of-concept test by following the original tutorial set out at [https://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/files/tutorial-dapc.pdf](https://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/files/tutorial-dapc.pdf). No claim is made whatsoever on authorship of this content and is intended as personal lab-book note taking.

## Imports
Our imports today are:

```{r}
library("adegenet")
library("vcfR")
library("readr")
data(dapcIllus)
```

Next, we need to import and convert our data set into the `genlight` object style provided by `adagenet`.
```{r}
vcf <- read.vcfR("ALL_IL1B.vcf")
samples <- read.csv("samples.csv")
x <- vcfR2genind(vcf)
```

If we want this DAPC to make sense, we will also have to tell the `adegenet` package how population structure is thought to look:
```{r}
pop(x) <- as.factor(samples$SUPER)
```

Unfortunately we don't know how many genetic clusters are present. Normally, we would run a few values of `k` so lets try that. the package exposes a function, `find.clusters` which does exactly this.
```{r, fig.cap="The performance of each number of potential clusters plotted as BIC values (Lower is better)"}
grp <- find.clusters(x, max.n.clust = 50, n.pca = 20)
```

Next, we need to unpack the result and display i t in legible form to make a decision:
```{r}
table(pop(x), grp$grp)
table.value(table(pop(x), grp$grp), col.lab = paste("infer", 1:6), row.lab = paste("original", 1:6))
```


## DAPC Execution

Now we are ready to actually run the DAPC. Normally, you would take the above number of true genetic clusters by looking at the elbow in the above BIC-optimized graph above.

```{r}
dapc_results <- dapc(x, grp$grp)
scatter(dapc_results, scree.pca = TRUE, posi.pca = "bottomleft", posi.da = "bottomright", leg = TRUE)
```
